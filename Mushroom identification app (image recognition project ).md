# Mushroom identification app (image recognition project )

***Introduction***
---

In the second year of study, I took the course related to AI. I and my team built a simple handwritten digit recognition model as our final project. It made me more interested in machine learning. So, when it became time for me to choose a topic for my project, I already knew what I want.

At the end of August, the mushroom season starts. Many Russians go to the forest and pick them. There are lots of different types of mushrooms. Unfortunately, not all of them are safe for humans. Ingestion of toxic mushrooms can cause malaise, poisoning, and sometimes even death. So, my idea is to create an application for mushroom identification to let people know the type of mushroom and if it is edible or poisonous. This can prevent cases from poisoning death and help people to distinguish various types of mushrooms.

***I chose this project because I want to:***

- Practice python and java
- Improve my applied ML skills
- Understand how to deploy ML models on mobile platforms
- Make android app

Several mobile applications for fungi identification that allows us to automatically classify the species of a mushroom from a picture are available online. But only a few have positive user reviews.

Examples of apps with positive reviews are: 

- Mushroom Identify with 1M+ downloads and a review score of 4.3/5, recognizing about 900 mushroom species
- Picture Mushroom - Mushroom ID with 10K+ downloads and a review score of 4.4/5

The apps above have additional functionalities (e.g. saving on a map the place where you found a mushroom, mushroom descriptions).
